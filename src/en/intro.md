> BondiFuzz - Fuzzing as a Service

BondiFuzz is a Fuzzing as a Service solution meant for stress-testing products by quick CI integration.

## How can BondiFuzz help?

- Automated search and preventive detection of issues, including software vulnerabilities.
- Improvement of code reliability.
- It helps to automate code coverage in tests, thus facilitating development and reducing its costs.
- Quick fuzzing initiation:
	- automated assessment of a vulnerability's severity;
	- automated management of resources of various fuzzing solutions.

## Why BondiFuzz?

Fuzzing is getting more and more popular. Yet, it may seem like a lot of work, as many fuzzing tools still look more like hacking utilities. Our team has found a way to do fuzzing without access to the source code. Thus, we could move the previous self-hosted version to the cloud.

## Integration into development

Integrating BondiFuzz into the development process allows you to improve the quality of your product significantly because continuous fuzzing tests with sufficient code coverage have an accumulative effect.

## Solution for different departments

BondiFuzz can be used by various departments involved in both software development and security:

- Developers: faster bug detection and readily available data for unit tests. The developer is notified of a bug, fixes it, and tests the fixed code.

- QA: better optimization with automated generation of unit tests based on fuzzing results.

- Security: automated analysis of error criticality and management of different fuzzing solutions' resources.
