# Projects

The fuzzing farm allows you to create projects inside which fuzzers are created, which makes it easier to work with fuzzing test suites. In addition to the `default` project, users can can create their own.

While creating or editing a project, you can create a task tracker integration. Thus, the bugs detected by a fuzzer will be sent to the task tracker. This facilitates the cooperation between the security and development teams.
